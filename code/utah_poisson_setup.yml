#Setup for application of Utah Poisson household vehicle count model to MAPC inputs
#If aggregate output data is desired, set aggregate flag to yes and populate output_agg_file and output_agg_fields list
#Otherwise set aggregate flag to no
#veh_fields is a list of fields to hold flags for various household vehicle counts. Should be ordered from zero. Final field is for n+ vehicles
